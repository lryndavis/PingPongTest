#The Ping Pong Test

##By Lauryn Davis 

### Description 

- The Ping Pong test is a program built using Javascript and JQuery.
- It allows the user to enter a number, then displays all numbers up to that number. 
- For multiples of 3, the page prints "PING"
- For multiples of 5, the page prints "PONG"
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, the page prints "PING-PONG!"
